# Sudoku_solver
A website that solves Sudoku with a Python backend.

Run `python3 main.py` to see it in action.

## To do

* Make the text bigger in the grid (easy, CSS).
* Color the cells differently based on the "square unit" they are in (easy, CSS).
* Change the CSS and make the borders of the cells in the square units thicker (medium, CSS).

### Javascript / AJAX visualizations

* Initialize the cells to have the numbers 1-9 in three rows.
* Display messages updating the cells as the Sudoku puzzle learns.
